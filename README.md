When people search cosmetics on a shopping website, there is usually another website that can sell the same product with a lower price. It takes much time for customers to search from many websites and compare prices. In addition, customers may not know some websites also sell the products they want.

We cooperate with different shopping websites and know their current prices and prices in the future. We provide different prices for same products for users.

If the price of a price is updated or decreased, we will print the new price and notify the user who bought the product before.

User can enter a price and a category, and we could suggest some products.
